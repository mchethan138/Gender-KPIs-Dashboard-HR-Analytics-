# üìä Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard

This project presents an end-to-end **Customer Churn Analysis** and **Risk Profiling** using Power BI. It is designed to help telecom or subscription-based service providers identify at-risk customers, analyze behavioral and demographic patterns, and take data-driven decisions to reduce churn and improve customer retention.

## üîç Project Overview

The dashboard is divided into two key views:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Churn Dashboard
Provides a high-level summary of churn-prone customers and insights into their profiles.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Risk Analysis Dashboard
Drills down into specific churn risk factors with interactive filters for churn probability, internet service, contract type, and subscription duration.
